            <h2>📚 Research Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Digital Trust Explorations</strong> is a PhD research project investigating the 
                multifaceted nature of trust in digital contexts. Through interactive experiments and 
                semantic analysis, this project seeks to understand how trust manifests, evolves, and 
                influences human behavior in digital environments.
            </p>

            <h2>🎯 Research Objectives</h2>
            <p>This research aims to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Examine trust-building mechanisms in human-computer interactions</li>
                <li>Develop interactive methodologies for studying trust dynamics</li>
                <li>Contribute empirical data to the field of digital trust research</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🔬 Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                The Research employs a mixed-methods approach combining:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Experiments:</strong> Interactive games and scenarios that reveal trust-related decision-making patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Qualitative Analysis:</strong> Understanding participant perspectives through open-ended responses</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🌐 Interactive Research Tools</h2>
            <p>
                The main idea behind this website is to host an expanding number of interactive trust experiments designed to collect data while 
                providing participants with engaging experiences:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Semantic Network Map:</strong> An interactive visualization exploring semantic connections</li>
                <li><strong>Game Theology:</strong> A behavioral experiment examining trust-based decision making</li>
                <li><em>More experiments coming soon...</em></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>📖 Publications & Outputs</h2>
            <p>
                Research findings and publications will be shared here as the project progresses.
            </p>

            <h2>🤝 Participation</h2>
            <p>
                This research relies on voluntary participation. All experiments are designed with 
                ethical considerations in mind, and participant data is handled according to research 
                ethics guidelines. By participating in any experiment, you contribute to advancing 
                our understanding of digital trust. 
            </p>
            
              <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                We don't use cookies, don't store personal data of any kind. 
                Trust experiments on the site only store the input you gave in the questionnaire, which is completely anon and not identifiable with any natural person.
                Always use a VPN for your connection though, the internet is a wild place!
